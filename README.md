### Description

The goal is to create a Twitter-like website. 

### Steps:

~~Create a small web application that runs completely in the browser.~~
~~It must be a web-application using react and rxjs.~~
~~Make sure that the application is build / running locally.~~
~~Take the tweets observable and render it as a list~~
~~Order the list by date descending.~~
~~Do not change the tweets observable.~~
~~Tweets older than 30 secs should not be shown in the list anymore.~~
~~Add the ability to like and unlike tweets.~~
~~A liked tweet must look visually different than the other tweets.~~
~~Above the list of tweets is a counter that shows the number of liked tweets contained within the list.~~
~~It must be possible to clear the list of tweets.~~
~~It must be possible to toggle between "all tweets" and "liked tweets".~~
Use a Twitter-like structure/style.
